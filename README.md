# unpacker_cpm_app

This is a repository to test using the unpacker (https://github.com/sbfoster12/unpacker) library with CPM (https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/tree/v0.42.0).

You can build the project with `./scripts/build.sh`.

Once built, you can run a test executable, which will be installed in `bin`. Run it with `./mu_app_cpm`. It will also install the unpackers exectuable `unpack`. See the unpacker repository for details.
